# 📚 Online Bookstore Management System

This project simulates an online bookstore system and includes everything from data modeling to relational and NoSQL database implementation, with an added smart assistant that lets you ask business questions in plain English and get results using MongoDB queries generated by an AI model.

## 🔧 Project Structure

### 📁 Project 1 - Data Modeling & Requirements
- `conceptual_data_model.png`: ER diagram of the bookstore system.
- `physical_data_model.png`: Table-level schema for database design.
- `data.xlsx`: Sample data used for testing.
- `requirements_analysis.pdf`: Summary of business rules and data needs.

### 📁 Project 2 - Relational Database Implementation (MySQL)
- `database_implementation.sql`: SQL scripts to create all tables and constraints.
- `single_table.sql`, `multi_table.sql`: Sample queries for analysis.
- `routines.sql`: Stored procedures and functions for business logic.
- `project02_pdm.png`: Physical data model used for SQL implementation.

### 📁 Project 3 - NoSQL Implementation (MongoDB + LLM Assistant)
This part includes both standard NoSQL document modeling **and** an intelligent assistant using LLMs to generate MongoDB aggregation queries based on natural language.

#### 📄 Files:
- `collection_creation.js`: Creates MongoDB collections.
- `collection.json`: Sample JSON data of customers and orders.
- `aggregate_pipelines.js`, `find_queries.js`: Predefined MongoDB queries for data analysis.
- `collection.pdf`: Describes document schema and collection structure.

#### 🧠 LLM-Powered Business Query Assistant (Integrated)
- `streamlit_app.py`: Web app to ask questions in plain English and get answers using MongoDB.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions to generate prompts and execute aggregation pipelines.
- `app.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook to test the assistant logic and query generation.
- Uses `LangChain` and `Mixtral-8x7B` model via OpenRouter API to generate real-time aggregation pipelines.
- Questions like *"Top 5 books by revenue?"* are automatically turned into pipelines and run on the data.

## 💡 Highlights
- Designed both conceptual (ERD) and physical (SQL/NoSQL) models for a bookstore system.
- Implemented optimized SQL schemas and queries using MySQL.
- Translated relational structures to a NoSQL format using MongoDB.
- Created an AI-based assistant that understands plain English and writes MongoDB queries.
- Built an interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time insights and query results.
